    Description - There are two battles as part of this simulation.
                    The first is to make sure that we are aware of what the reward is for the fight without changes.
                    The second is to see if the changes made by the model improved the fight or not. 
                    No difference between the fight results in a reward of 0. 
                    Losing by less the second time means an improvement even if the agent still lost. 
                    When this model trains on data provided from the self-play games and is trained to some degree,
                    both boards will be moderately well positioned. The idea is it should find a maximum where it can
                    no longer improve the positioning of the board from what it is given.
